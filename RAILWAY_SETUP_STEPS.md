# ðŸš€ Railway Setup - Step by Step Guide

## Current Issue: "Failed to get private network endpoint" + "1/1 replicas never became healthy"

This guide will fix both issues.

## Step 1: Railway Project Configuration

### 1.1 Go to Railway Dashboard
- Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- Navigate to your project

### 1.2 Generate Public Domain
1. Go to **Settings > Networking**
2. In the **Public Networking** section, click **"Generate Domain"**
3. When asked for **Port Number**, enter: **`3000`**
4. Click **Generate** or **Confirm**
5. **Copy the generated domain** (e.g., `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`)

### 1.3 Disable Private Networking (if enabled)
1. In the same **Networking** settings
2. Look for **Private Networking** section
3. If it's enabled, **disable it** for now
4. Save changes

## Step 2: Environment Variables Setup

### 2.1 Go to Variables Tab
1. In your Railway project, go to **Variables** tab
2. Add these environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
SMTP_HOST=smtp.zoho.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=admin@cogni-sphere.com
SMTP_PASS=6EubGLUDuCZy
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@cogni-sphere.com
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-generated-domain.up.railway.app
```

**Important:** Replace `your-generated-domain` with the actual domain you got from Step 1.2

### 2.2 Verify Variables
- Make sure all variables are set correctly
- No extra spaces or quotes
- Case-sensitive

## Step 3: Deploy and Test

### 3.1 Trigger Deployment
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **"Deploy"** or **"Redeploy"**
3. Wait for build to complete

### 3.2 Check Build Logs
Look for these success indicators:
- âœ… `npm ci` completed successfully
- âœ… `ðŸš€ Railway Startup Script` appears
- âœ… `âœ… Environment validation passed`
- âœ… `ðŸš€ Starting server...`
- âœ… `âœ… Server running on port 3000`

### 3.3 Test Health Endpoints
1. Visit: `https://your-generated-domain.up.railway.app/health`
   - Should return: `OK`
2. Visit: `https://your-generated-domain.up.railway.app/api/health`
   - Should return JSON with status info

## Step 4: Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting "1/1 replicas never became healthy":

1. **Check Railway Status**
   - Visit [status.railway.app](https://status.railway.app)
   - Check for platform issues

2. **Try Different Port**
   - Change `PORT=3000` to `PORT=8080` in environment variables
   - Update the port in Railway networking settings

3. **Check Logs**
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Click on the latest deployment
   - Check **Runtime Logs** for errors

### If Getting "Failed to get private network endpoint":

1. **Disable Private Networking**
   - Go to Settings > Networking
   - Turn off Private Networking
   - Use only Public Networking

2. **Create New Project**
   - Sometimes Railway projects get corrupted
   - Create a completely new project
   - Follow steps 1-3 again

## Step 5: Verify Full Functionality

### 5.1 Test Website
1. Visit your Railway domain
2. Navigate to different pages
3. Test the contact form

### 5.2 Test Booking System
1. Go to Contact Us page
2. Try scheduling a meeting
3. Verify emails are sent

## Expected Success Flow

1. âœ… Build completes without errors
2. âœ… Railway startup script runs
3. âœ… Environment variables validated
4. âœ… Server starts on port 3000
5. âœ… Health check responds
6. âœ… Website loads correctly
7. âœ… Booking system works
8. âœ… Emails are sent

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Failed to get private network endpoint" | Disable private networking, use public domain |
| "1/1 replicas never became healthy" | Check port configuration, increase healthcheck timeout |
| Build fails | Check package.json and package-lock.json sync |
| Environment variables not set | Double-check all variables in Railway dashboard |
| Health check fails | Verify server starts and responds on correct port |
